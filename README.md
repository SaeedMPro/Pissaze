# Online Shopping System - Pissaze

This project focuses on designing and implementing the backend and frontend for **Pissaze**, an online shopping platform. The system includes **user management, shopping cart functionality, referral systems, purchase history tracking, and activity logging**. 

The project is structured into two main parts:
- **Backend**: Developed using **Go (Golang)** with the **Gin framework** and **PostgreSQL** as the database.
- **Frontend**: Developed using **Next.js**, providing a modern UI.

## Database Design

The project was initially developed as part of a **Database Systems course**, with a strong focus on **database design and implementation**. An **Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) model** was used in the initial design phase to ensure **clarity, scalability, and optimized database performance**. The database uses **PostgreSQL**, with `pg_cron` for scheduled tasks.
